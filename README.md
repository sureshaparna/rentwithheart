(Please give the "suburb recommender" page a moment to load.) 

Rent with Heart is an application that was built as a part of my final semester project. With the increase in the unavailability of affordable rental houses in Australia, Rent with heart helps user find affordable suburbs in Victoria, Australia.

The suburb recommender asks the user preferences and gives them the suitable suburbs that they look for houses at.

The orange portion highlighted in the map is the output for the user entered filters. This indicates that this is the ideal suburb for a person with the provided details.

### Support Services
This page shows the user the available support systems that they can reach out to. This page asks the user if they are looking for services specifically in Victoria or not. 
The user can enter the suburb and see the supporting organisations, thei name, their email, phone number, and the services they provide, so that the user can reach out to them if needed.
